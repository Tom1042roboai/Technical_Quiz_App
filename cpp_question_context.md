# C++ Question Context & Metadata

## Core C++ Concepts for Quiz Questions

### Memory Management
- Stack vs heap allocation
- new/delete operators and malloc/free
- Smart pointers: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Memory leaks and dangling pointers

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and objects
- Constructors and destructors
- Inheritance: public, private, protected
- Virtual functions and polymorphism
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
- Multiple inheritance and virtual inheritance

### Language Features
- References vs pointers
- Function overloading and operator overloading
- Templates: function and class templates
- Const correctness and const methods
- Static members and methods
- Friend functions and classes

### STL (Standard Template Library)
- Containers: vector, list, map, set, unordered_map
- Iterators and algorithms
- Function objects and lambdas
- Standard algorithms: sort, find, transform

### Advanced Features
- Exception handling: try, catch, throw
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- Auto keyword and type deduction
- Range-based for loops
- Namespaces and scope resolution

### Modern C++ (C++11/14/17/20)
- Smart pointers and move semantics
- Lambda expressions
- Auto and decltype
- Variadic templates
- Constexpr and compile-time computation
