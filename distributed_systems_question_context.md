# Distributed Systems Question Context & Metadata

## Core Distributed Systems Concepts for Quiz Questions

### Fundamental Concepts
- CAP Theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
- ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- BASE properties: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency
- Distributed consensus: Paxos, Raft algorithms
- Byzantine fault tolerance and Byzantine generals problem
- Two-phase commit protocol
- Vector clocks and logical clocks

### Scalability & Performance
- Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Load balancing strategies: round-robin, least connections, weighted
- Caching strategies: write-through, write-back, cache-aside
- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
- Database sharding and partitioning
- Microservices vs monolithic architecture
- Auto-scaling and elasticity

### Data Management
- Replication strategies: master-slave, master-master
- Consistency models: strong, eventual, weak consistency
- Distributed hash tables (DHT)
- Data partitioning strategies
- Conflict resolution in distributed databases
- Distributed transactions
- Event sourcing and CQRS

### Communication & Coordination
- Message passing vs shared memory
- Synchronous vs asynchronous communication
- Service discovery mechanisms
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Bulkhead pattern
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event-driven architecture

### Fault Tolerance & Reliability
- Failure detection mechanisms
- Redundancy and replication
- Graceful degradation
- Disaster recovery strategies
- Split-brain problem
- Quorum-based systems
- Health checks and monitoring
